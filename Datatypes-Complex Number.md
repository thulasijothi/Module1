# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Write a python program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a complex number. Print the imaginary part of the complex number.


## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start the program.
2.Read the first number from the user (this will be the real part).
3.Read the second number from the user (this will be the imaginary part).
4.Convert these two numbers into a complex number using the complex(real, imaginary) function.
5.Print the complete complex number.
6.Extract the imaginary part of the complex number using the .imag attribute.
7.Print the imaginary part.
8.End the program.

## ðŸ’» Program
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
real=a
imaginary=b
c=complex(real,imaginary)
print(c)
print(c.imag)

## Output

## Result
This program  program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a complex number. Print the imaginary part of the complex number is successfully executed.
